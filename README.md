### Step to follow while working on the task (GitHub Desktop) -

---

Step - 1 : Create a `new-branch` from the `main-branch` with `task-name` along with prefix of `fix` (for fixing any bug) or `feat` (for adding a new feature). For Example -

```
fix/resolved-login-error

feat/added-live-streaming
```

Step - 2 : After the completion of your task, `commit` your changes into your `branch` with the `meaningful` commit message (similar to the branch name) with the prefix of `fix` or `feat` respectively. For Example -

```
fix - resolved login error

feat - added live streaming
```

Step - 3 : `Publish` your created branch onto the GitHub and `create a pull request` from your branch into the main branch. (`make sure your PR don't have more than 2 commit messages`)

Step - 4 : `Delete` your branch, once it is merged into the `main` branch by your fellow developer after reviewing your code.

### Note -

- Don't commit your changes directly into the main branch

- For Formatting the code use `Prettier` and `ESLint`

- Follow the `naming` conventions for creating `Components` and `Files`
